      <p>Although born in Canada, I also have the luxury of also being an American Citizen.  I moved from Canada when I was 18 and came to the United States on a Basketball Scholarship and finished my college athletic career with a volleyball and track and field scholarship.
      </p>

      <p>I started in Utah and then finished college in Idaho.
      </p>

      <p>From there I moved to Sacramento and starting working for an insurance company as a claims adjuster for auto injuries.  Of course this had nothing to do with my major but it was a quick job out of college that paid well and I ended up being a claims adjuster for 16 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        I moved to Seattle about 2 years ago.  I quit my job last month and that's my very short story.
